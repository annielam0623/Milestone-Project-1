Gomoku 

A traditional board game, also called Five in a Row.

Players got either Black or White stone on a Go board (15 X 15).

Rules:

Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
***Placing so that a line of more than five stones of the same color is created does not result in a win
